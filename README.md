# **Boozy Food**

### **Project Description:**
##### This site was inspired by not having easy access to a grocery store while COVID-19 was disrupting the supply chain in grocery stores. The Spoontacular API would generate several recipes based on up to three food items you have at your disposal. On the left-hand side, we added a random drink generator to give you inspiration for a drink of your choice you'd like to make. The color palette consists of warm tones.
